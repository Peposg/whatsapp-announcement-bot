# whatsapp-announcement-bot
whatsapp-announcement-bot is an open-source Node.js automation project that lets you send announcement messages — manually or automatically — to one or more WhatsApp groups or private chats. It uses the whatsapp-web.js library to interact with WhatsApp Web securely, requiring only a QR code scan to link your account.
